Real world assets will be represented as nonfungible tokens stored in distributed ledgers. Meaning, less paperwork, less bureaucracy, and the removal of intermediaries. Lowering the cost and time spent on red tape. Also, it will provide users with the simplicity of owning the certificates digitally, and both creating and transferring them becomes effortless. To realize this vision, technology must come to be intuitive and easy to use, the technical pain has to be lowered, and users have to be seduced with a simple and elegant interface. </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://tokenizate.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Tokenizate</a> we recognize this trend and stride toward this vision. Accordingly, we are offering a series of tools and consultancy for notaries that let them try blockchain technologies, easing them into the ecosystem, enabling them to opt-in at a comfortable pace.\nAs a first step, we are identifying possible use cases that can be implemented alongside the current legal system. We are providing an escrow system that has been developed and deployed, so notaries and other parties can oversee transaction operations on the Ethereum network. Also, we are establishing partners and preparing the issue of a tokenized mortgage, providing liquidity to the credit issued, meaning that credit is minted, and can then be used as collateral to stake, creating trust. </p>\n<p>We are working on gaining traction and attracting consumers. To achieve this goal, it must be clear we are after no one’s job, but here to enhance and facilitate the work of lawyers, by providing new and better tools, so they can better serve their clients. Also, we must not scare them away with complicated concepts and technicalities, such as blockchain, smart contracts, and the like. The solution must be elegant and hide the complexity of the web3 implementations, soo users can focus on doing their job. The usage of the platform must feel intuitive and natural, removing the usage of wallets, transactions, and key management. This is why we see onboard as the right fit, and we are planning to run a test integration, wrapping the emyto escrow dapp in sexy.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/onboard-token/","tagSlugs":["/tag/technology/","/tag/blockchain/","/tag/english/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-08-31T23:46:37.121Z","description":"Making ethereum easier to use.","tags":["Technology","Blockchain","English"],"title":"Onboarding the tokenized economy","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/onboard-token/"}}}
